<p>At Open Collective we believe that communication is key for a project to succeed. Share regularly updates about your progress, your activities but also the difficulties that you are facing. Your community wants to know how things are going. Don't leave them in the dark. Go ahead and <a href="https://opencollective.com/{{collective.slug}}/updates/new">publish an update</a>.</p>

<p>Let us know if you need any help setting things up, we are here to help your collective succeed.</p>

<p>Feel free to schedule a call (<a href="http://calendly.com/piamancini/call">calendly.com/piamancini/call</a>), email me or <a href="https://slack.opencollective.com">join us on our Slack</a>. We would love to know your story.</p>
