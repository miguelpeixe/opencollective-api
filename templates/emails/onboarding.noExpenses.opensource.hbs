Subject: Make your Expenses transparent to your community

{{> header}}

<h1>Hello {{collective.name}}</h1>

<p>I noticed that you haven't filed any expenses yet. My suggestion: be open about your costs. </p>

<p>You don’t have to wait until you have funds. Go ahead and submit expenses now, to let potential backers know what
  they'll be funding. Transparency builds trust.</p>

<p>Some common expenses include: travel to conferences, hosting & domain name fees, printing t-shirts & stickers, food
  for meetups, and invoicing for time spent. </p>

<p>If you’re looking for more expense ideas, read this: <a

    Your Open Source Community Raised Money? Here’s How to Spend
    It</a>.</p>

<p>Key info:</p>
