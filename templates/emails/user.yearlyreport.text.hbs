Hi {{collective.name}}!

{{year}} is already ending 🎉. That was fast!

In these troubled times of social unrest and climate change, we believe more than ever in the strength of our communities.
Whereas big institutions that surround us are increasingly unable to make our voice heard, our communities make our contributions matter.
They give us an opportunity to connect and to learn from each other.
They give us the opportunity to make meaningful contributions. They give us meaning.

But we need to nurture them. They need us. They need us to contribute with our time and our skills, to attend their events, to promote them in our social networks and to support them financially.
If we all do that, we will be surrounded by thriving communities that will give everyone of us the opportunity to do meaningful contributions in the world 🌍
