{{> header}}

<h1>Hello {{collective.name}} ðŸ‘‹</h1>

<p>Hi! Thanks again for signing up your Organization to Open Collective.</p>

<p>Weâ€™re seeking to improve the sponsor experience, and we have a few questions for you:</p>
<ol>
  <li>Are there any projects you want to sponsor who arenâ€™t on Open Collective yet? Let us know and weâ€™ll help them get
    set up</li>
  <li>Is there a reward or service a Collective could offer that would provide you more value or make budget
    justification easier?</li>
  <li>Is there anything else about the Organization or Sponsorship experience we could improve</li>
</ol>
<p>Thank you for any feedback you can provide! Let us know if thereâ€™s anything we can do to help.</p>
