Hi {{host.name}}!

{{year}} is already ending ðŸŽ‰. That was fast!

We would like to thank you for being a host on Open Collective. Thanks to you, {{stats.collectives.hosted}} {{{pluralize "collective" n=stats.collectives.hosted}}} can collect and disburse money to pursue their mission without having to worry about setting up another legal entity and managing the accounting. Together, they collected {{{currency stats.totalDonations currency=host.currency}}} in {{year}}.

This is possible thanks to the {{{number stats.backers.users}}} individuals and {{{number stats.backers.organizations}}} organizations that have supported them in {{year}}.
They deserve a shout out! We are attaching an export with all their email addresses and total amount donated so that you can send them a thank you note.
