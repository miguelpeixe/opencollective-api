    "description": "<p>It's an informal bar meetup where you can share all the things we should improve (the event formula, venues, themes, etc) so the impact.tech community gets what it needs to grow stronger. It will also be a great excuse to spend some time together and get to know each other better. Hope you can make it!</p> <p>Boring technicalities (yaaawn): We are not charging for this meetup andÂ <a href=\"https://opencollective.com/impacttech\" class=\"linkified\">https://opencollective.com/impacttech</a> membership is not required but it's at a bar so we expect everyone to get their own drinks. Please bring an ID (21+)</p> ",
