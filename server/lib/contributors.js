/**
 * This file aims to group all the logic related to the concept of "Contributor".
 *
 * A contributor is a person or an entity that contributes financially or by any other
 * mean to the mission of the collective. While "Member" is dedicated to permissions
 * and can have multiple entries for the same collective (one for BACKER role, one  for ADMIN...etc)
 * contributors should surface only unique collectives.
